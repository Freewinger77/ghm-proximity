MTN Cash is the most preferred cash-out option for money transfers. Most users want money to stay in receivers' bank accounts." }, "originalQuestionsAnalysis": { "question1": { "question": "What could the issues be?", "response": "The user did not provide any specific issues or challenges they are facing." }, "question2": { "question": "What specific actions were taken?", "response": "The user did not mention any specific actions they took or plan to take." }, "question3": { "question": "Who will take these actions?", "response": "There are no actions identified that need to be taken by anyone." }, "question_ai": { "question": "What were the key points spoken?", "response": "The user mentioned that there were issues with the app when they clicked the home button." } }, "keyIssuesIdentified": { "Money Transfer": 7, "Bank Partnerships": 4, "Account Creation": 2, "User Experience": 1 }, "breakthroughInsights": { "synthesisedInsights": [ { "insight": "Local account preference", "source": "User feedback on account retention" }, { "insight": "MTN Cash popularity", "source": "Transaction data analysis" }, { "insight": "Simplify account creation", "source": "User experience reports" }, { "insight": "Transfer fee concerns", "source": "Customer support inquiries" }, { "insight": "Mobile app usage growth", "source": "App analytics" }, { "insight": "Improve support response", "source": "Customer service logs" }, { "insight": "International transfer demand", "source": "Market research" } ] }, "totalResponses": { "value": 18 } }  General guidelines: Make sure the output format is in json string as specified (as a string but without the json tag). Ensure key issues identified conform to the number of mentions of those words or context which can be insightful for the analyst looking at the results. Make sure the number of responses are accurately calculated so they cannot be changed. Make sure the insights and answers are provided in the same language as the transcript when returning a response. For example if the transcript is in french, the insights generated and responses must also be in french. Ensure the totalResponses is a count of User: and AI: interaction counts. Ensure the source contains both the AI question and the user response (in the same line) relevant for the extracted insight (for eg. if the insight is user found service to be excellent. the source is like AI: What made you say that? User: Well your service was really good) Provide the top 7-8 insights form these transcripts and questions. Provide only the json formatted string, nothing else.

Your task is to analyze user responses in transcripts and identify the top 4 most mentioned issues or keywords in response to specific questions. You will also count the number of times each issue is mentioned to quantify its significance.\n\n**Instructions:**  \n- Given a transcript, analyze responses for each question.\n- Extract the top 4 most mentioned issues or keywords.\n- Count the occurrences of each issue within the context of the response.\n- Provide the output in JSON format.\n\n**Output Format Example:**  \n```json\n{\n  "question1": {\n    "question": "What do you like about the product?",\n    "metrics": {\n      "ease of use": 5,\n      "design": 3,\n      "performance": 2,\n      "price": 2\n    }\n  },\n  "question2": {\n    "question": "What challenges do you face with the product?",\n    "metrics": {\n      "slow performance": 4,\n      "bugs": 3,\n      "high cost": 2,\n      "complex UI": 2\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Few-Shot Example:**  \n\n**transcript:**  \nHuman: I really love how easy the product is to use. The interface is intuitive, and I never feel lost. But I do wish it had more customization options.\nAI: Noted, ease of use and intuitive interface are positives, while lack of customization is a concern.\n\nHuman: The design is sleek and modern, which I appreciate. However, the performance can sometimes be slow when loading data-heavy tasks.\nAI: Design aesthetics are a positive aspect, while slow performance is a noted issue.\n\nquestions:\n1. What do you like about the product?  \n2. What challenges do you face with the product?  \n\n**Expected Output:**  \n{\n  "question1": {\n    "question": "What do you like about the product?",\n    "metrics": {\n      "ease of use": 1,\n      "intuitive interface": 1,\n      "sleek design": 1,\n      "modern aesthetics": 1\n    }\n  },\n  "question2": {\n    "question": "What challenges do you face with the product?",\n    "metrics": {\n      "lack of customization": 1,\n      "slow performance": 1\n    }\n  }\n}\n**General Guidelines**\nOnly provide the json object as the output without the json tags.\n\nHere is the data you need to use now:',
